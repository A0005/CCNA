1 - Computer Network:
    A computer network is a digital telecommunications network which allows nodes to share resources.
    
2 - Client:
    A client is a device that accesses a service made available by a server.
    
3 - Server:
    A device that provides functions or services for clients.
    
4 - Switches: Catalyst 9200, Catalyst 3650
    Switches have many network interfaces/ports for end hosts to connect to. (usually 24+).
    Switches provide connectivity to hosts within the same LAN (Local Area Network).
    Switches do not provide connectivity between LANs/over the Internet.
    
 5 - Routers: ISR 1000, ISR 900, ISR 4000
     Routers have fewer network interfaces than switches.
     Routers are used to provide connectivity between LANs.
     Routers are therefore used to send data over the Internet.
     
 6 - Firewalls: ASA 5500-X, Firepower 2100
     Firewalls monitor and control network traffic based on configured rules.
     Firewalls can be placed 'inside the network' or 'outside the network'.
     Firewalls are known as 'Next-gerneration Firewalls' when they include more modern and advanced filtering capabilities.
     
 7 - Network Firewalls:
     They are hardware devices that filter traffic between networks.
     
 8 - Host-Based Firewalls:
     They are software applications that filter traffic entering and exiting a host machine, like a PC.
