1 - Ethernet:
    
    Ethernet is a collection of network protocols/standards.
    
2 - Ethernet Standards:

    Defined in the IEEE 802.3 standard in 1983.
    IEEE: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.

    10 Gbps   10 Gig Ethernet   802.3an        10GBASE-T       100 m
    
4 - UTP Cables:

    Unshielded Twisted Pair Cables.
    Protects against EMI Electromagnetic Interference).
    
5 - 10BASE-T and 100BASE-T use 2 pairs (4 wires)

6 - 1000BASE-T and 10GBASE-T use 4 pairs (8 wires)

7 - Full Duplex: Both devices can send and receive data at the same time.

8 - Straight-Through Cable: Pin 1 connects to Pin 1 etc..

9 - Crossover Cable: Pin 1 connects to Pin 3 and Pin 2 connects to Pin 6
                     Pin 3 connects to Pin 1 and Pin 6 connects to Pin 2

10 - Auto MDI-X: Allows to detect which pins are being transfered by data and auto adjust the ending pins in order to receive the data.

11- UTP Cables (10BASE-T, 100BASE-T)

    Device Type     Transmit (Tx) Pins       Receive (Rx) Pins   
    Router          1 and 2                  3 and 6                 
    Firewall        1 and 2                  3 and 6                
    PC              1 and 2                  3 and 6             
    Switch          3 and 6                  1 adn 2
     
12 - SFP Tansceiver:
     (Small Form-Factor Pluggable)
     
13 - Fiber-Optic Connections: Made of 4 parts
     
     The fiberglass core itself.
     Cladding that reflects light.
     A protctive buffer.
     The outer jacket of the cable.
     
14 - Multimode Fiber:
     
     Core diameter is wider than single-mode fiber.
     Allows multiple angles (modes) of light waves to enter the fiberglass core.
     Allows longer cables than UTP, but shorter cables than single-mode fiber.
     Cheaper than single-mode fiber (due to cheaper LED-based SFP transmitters).
     
15 - Singlemode Fiber:

     Core diameter is narrower than multimode fiber.
     Light enters at a single angle (mode) from a laser-based transmitter.
     Allows longer cables than both UTP and multimode fiber.
     More expensive than multimode fiber (due to more expensive laser-based SFP transmitters.
     
16 - Fiber-Optic Cable Standards:
    
     Infromal Name    IEEE Standard   Speed      Cable Type                 Maximum Length 
     1000BASE-LX      802.3z          1 Gbps     Multimode or Single-Mode   550 m (MM), 5km (SM)
     10GBASE-SR       802.3ae         10 Gbps    Multimode                  400 m
     10GBASE-LR       802.3ae         10 Gbps    Single-Mode                10 km
     10GBASE-ER       802.3ae         10 Gbps    Single-Mode                30 km
     
17 - UTP   
    
     1 - Lower Cost than fiber-optic.
     2 - Shorter maximum distance than fiber-optic (~100m).
     3 - Can be vulnerable to EMI (Eletromagnetic Interference).
     4 - RJ45 ports used with UTP are cheaper than SFP ports.
     5 - Emit (leak) a faint signal outside of the cable, which can be copied (=security risk)
     
18 - Fiber-Optic

     1 - Higer cost than UTP
     2 - Longer maximum distance than UTP.
     3 - No vulnerability to EMI.
     4 - SFP ports are more expensive than RJ45 ports (single-mode is more expensive thab multimode).
     5 - Does not emit any signal outside of the cable (=no security risk).
